            <p style="width: 400px; float: left;"> Hi, I am Katie. I'm a first year HCDE Masters student. I want to learn about digital fabrication to gain a better understanding 
		    of how to build 3 dimensional products. In this class I want to learn how to use a variety of CAD programs and machinery so 
		    I am able to build physical models of my designs. I am hoping I can share my knowledge of Adobe Creative Suite, HTML, and CSS with others.
