            <h1>Diamond Mold</h1>
          <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">Over the past two weeks I have been learning how to make molds. Here is a recap of 
		  the progress I made in the first week:
            </p>
            
           <h1>Week 1: Building Diamonds</h1>
          <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left"> A few years ago, a co-worker brought in
              diamond shaped handmade soaps and I thought these were really awesome. The shape and color of her soaps was my inspiration for this week. I
              first created my diamond shape in Rhino using two hexagon polygons and a point as the beginning of the shape. I then concentrically aligned them,
              combined them with the loft command with the setting of split at tangents, then used the cap planar holes command, and this was the resulting beauty!
            </p>
            
            <p align="center">
                <img src="diamond.png" height=300></a>
                
                
               
            </p><br><br>

            <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">Next, I used the draft angle analysis. I was not surprised when I saw the divide of red and blue at the widest points of 
                the polygon, but I was 
                thinking It might be easier to print the mold symetrically down the the vertical center to create a mold where I could hide the seams
                in the seams of the diamond, but then I realized I would have a seam on the top of the diamond, so I went back to the original 
                draft angle analysis. I also thought this would be the better way to explode the shape because I could fill it from the top and I could 
                leave a hole open so I could see when the mold was fully filled, and wouldnâ€™t have excess in the hole.
                
            </p>

                <img src="draft2.png" height=300></a>
                 
            </p><br><br>

            <p style="width: 650px;; display: inline-block; text-align: left">I created a surface that divided the shape and then I exploded it. I grouped the surfaces to create the two sides 
                to the mold. Next I did a ribbon offset. Since my shape is divided on the horizontal axis, there was no need for me to make another 
                offset with a 0 curve. I did use two offsets to create a planar surface which I connected to the ribbon offset. Then I extruded the sides
                of the planar surface to create the base of the mold. I learned about the shift command keyboard function to 
                select only the top layer of the box to delete it. Finally, I used BooleanDiference to create the pour hole in the top of the top mold.
            </p>

            </p><br><br>

            <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">With both sides of my mold created, I added my keys. I did this by aligning the two pieces on top of each other and 
                adding spheres for the keys. Next I copied all of the pieces, and used BooleanUnion on one side and BooleanDifference on the other. Finally,
                I had to take both pieces of the mold and add the surrounding box to use for the silicone. I drew the boxes and used the BooleanDifference
                command to create the silicone mold. I then printed it. That's my mold progress for the week. Keep reading to see my work for the second week.

<h1>Week 2: Finishing the Diamonds!</h1>
          <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">As you can tell from the image above, I had a few gaps in the printing on the side of the
		  bottom mold. I tried a few different types of glue, including Elmers, putty, and Bondo, but none of them filled in the hole. I am thinking it is because 
		  the shape of the hole was more of a shingle construction, so it was hard for the glue to stay and remain smooth and adhered to my mold while I sanded. After
		  trying multiple glues I decided I had to reprint the mold. This time I changed the infill to lines, which had more structure around the edges of the print,
		  hoping that setting would help prevent the shingle gaps, and it did. Even my keys were cleaner and printed better.
            </p>
            
            <p align="center">
                <img src="badmold.jpg" height=300></a>
                <img src="goodprint.jpg" height=300></a>
             
                
               
            </p><br><br>

            <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">With the new mold ready to go I began mixing my silicone. For my silicone I used
		    OOMOO35. I gathered my supplies and headed to the balcony. After thoroughly reading the directions, per Professor Nadya's direction, I carefully started the
		    mixing process. I must say, having face shields around, due to the pandemic, also came in handy for maintaining safety during this process. I carefully put
		    equal parts of the blue mixture in one container, and pink in the other. Before I combined them, I stirred both really well, and then poured both into a shared
		    container where I stirred the mixture for the recommended 3 minutes to ensure it was thoroughly mixed. Then I poured the silicone in the mold, and the waiting
		    game began. 
            </p>

            </p><br><br>


            <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">After six hours the silicone was cured, and it was time to begin making ice cubes. 
		    I didn't have any rubberbands at my house, so I used string I to secure my mold together, since I was pouring water in the 
		    mold. I also had this grandiose idea that I could add food coloring and food glitter
		    to make really cool ice cubes where the food coloring and glitter were suspended in the middle of the ice cube, but I didn't realize that
		    the water wouldn't freeze fast enough (these ice cubes took roughly 5.5 hours to freeze completely) and by the time the ice cube was completely frozen
		    all of the food coloring had dispersed, and you couldn't really see the glitter. That was very disappointing. However, the mold was 
		    succcessful, so I continued playing with more colors. 
            </p>

            </p><br><br>

            <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">I didn't think the string had an effect on the mold process, so I removed it for 
		    the next few molds, but then I realized that a little bit of water escaping was causing the tops of the diamonds to be smaller.
                                                                                  
            </p>
           
              <p align="center">
                <img src="filledmold.jpg" height=300></a>
		<img src="badtops.jpg" height=300></a>
                 
            </p><br><br>

 		<p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left"> I went
		    back to the string process and the mold was successful again. Although the visual color design of the ice cubes didn't turn out how I was
		    originally planning, I do like the ombre colors and I am planning on buying food safe silicone so I can start making these more often.
