            <h1>Part 1: Final Project Proposal</h1>
          <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">CONCEPT<br>For my final project I wanted to create a series of pieces. After much thought I 
		  decided I wanted to make two sets of chess pieces. Santiago Calatrava is one of my 
		  favorite architects and his projects Turning Torso and Chicago Spire were the design inspirations for this project. The aim is to create a 
		  more sculptural and modern version of these classic pieces. 
            </p>

            <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">RENDERING<br>Below is a rendering of the intended final design. I hope to create one set 
		    that is gold and one set that is black, both in PLA filament.

            </p><br><br>

            <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left">TIMELINE<br>As shown above, the design and rendering for this project is complete. For this process I plan to 3D print each set in 3 groups each. 
		    The first group will be all 8 pawns (approximate printing time: 4 hrs. and 15 mins.).<br> The second set will include both bishops, 
		    both knights and both rooks for a total of 6 pieces (approximate printing time: 6 hrs and 15 mins.).<br>The third set will be the 
		    king and queen (approximiate printing time: 8 hrs.).<br>Total print time for each set is about 18.5 hours. If time wasnt an issue I would print
		    one set and cast the other. However, casting would take a great deal of time to print molds and cure silicone for 6 separate pieces, and I want to ensure there
		    is enough room in my timeline in case something goes wrong. Because I am using two different
		    colors for these sets, for the interest of time, I am going to print the gold set then the black set instead of printing by the piece shape. Because
		    the sketches are finished in Rhino, my goal is to complete one set each week. To give myself some extra time in case something goes awry, I plan to 
		    have the first set finished by Monday, May 24th, and the second set by Monday May 31st. 
		    If I get completely off track for this project and the printing goes sideways my contingency plan is to print one set instead of two. If I
		    more than 2 weeks I would make one set in PLA and one set cast in plaster

            <p style="width: 650px; display: inline-block; text-align: left"> Using the MeshtoNURB command for all three objects I was able to successfully turn them into polysurfaces. I then aligned all three objects in the top view
                using concentric align. Once all three pieces were placed where I wanted, I used the BooleanUnion command. I examined the new object and it was closed.
                I exported it with a 0.001mm tolerance.
