            <h1>Grasshopper - Clips and Nesting</h1>
          <p style="width: 400px"> I must admit, learning Grasshopper last week was little intimidating, but once I had time to experiment and understand how
            it works, I had a lot of fun building this week.
            </p><br><br>
            
            <p style="font-size:36px">CLIPS</p>
            <p style="width: 400px">
              I started working on the clips first. The inspiration for my clips this week was a bobby pin. I first found a picture of a bobby pin on the 
              internet, and then I turned it into a vector in Illustrator, just like in week 1. Because I knew I was going to have to be able to clip two 
              layers of cardboard together, I adjusted the sketch to accomodate the width of two layers of cardboard. Once the vector artwork was finished
              I moved it into Rhino, and opened Grasshopper.<br><br>I highlighted the image and set it as a curve in Grasshopper. Next, I added the Offset Curve,
              and added a slider to the distance so I could easily adjust the space of the clip if needed. After, I added an extrude for both the original 
              curve and the offset curve so I could control the height of each of the walls indpendently. My final move in Grasshopper was to group the extrusions 
              together and bake them. I then put a simple cap on the bobby pin, exported the design with a 0.001 extrusion (understanding how to manipulate 
              meshes especially on curved surfaces has really helped me this week). I sliced it in Cura with Standard quality settings, with a skirt, changig the 
              infill pattern to cubic, and updating the mesh resolution and travel resolution to .5. I had to adjust the clip distance after my print was wayyyy 
              too big, but on the next print I was able to print a successful width, and proceeded to print all 10. See below for my excitement over the success 
              of my clips.

            <p style="font-size:36px">NESTING</p>
            <p style="width: 400px">Nesting was an interesting expereince, but the instruction from class last week was pretty easy to follow. I first 
                drew a star in Illustrator and imported it into Rhino. I set it as a curve in Grasshopper and then the fun began. I thought the easiest 
                path to success wwas to make enough offset curves to be able to generate 3 stars. I made multiple offset curves until I had enough. Next 
                I created separate extrusioins for each wall (I'll explain later why I did this instead of them sharing the same slider for extrusion height). 
                Once all the walls were built and the extrusions were correct, I group the walls accoring to the 3 nests and baked each of them separately.
                Next, I capped each in Rhino, but each time I did a Boolean difference to ensure the stars were outlines and not solid objects. I exported
                the design, and because there were no curves, I used 0.00 extrusion. Once in Cura, I sliced this with low quality settings, and infill lines. 
                Once the print started I immediately had problems with the top and botton layer pattern settings, but I was able to change the pattern to concentric
                so it printed easier. I started my second print and thought it was a success, but then I realized the top point in my middle circle had lifted. 
                This resulted in a quick bed adjustment, a reprint, and a successful print. This was the longest print I have done so far at 2 hours. It was nerve
                wracking because I was worried something would go wrong and the time would be wasted, but I was pleased by this process. The reason I made each wall 
                have a different extrusion is because I want to try a print where the tops of the stars aren't level, but they gradually decline from the center star.
                I haven't finished this yet, but I wanted the oportunity to start it now, rather than later.

                Once in Illustrator, I live traced the object, creating the vector points. Once I was satisified with the 
                vector files I exported the shapes as .dxf files.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                 <img src="exploded.png" height=300></a>

            </p>
            <p>
               Next, I imported the .dxf file into Rhino. I exploded the shape so I could see the vector points, and make sure my objects were closed.
            </p><br><br>
            
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               Then I used the offset function to create an outer wall (.1").

              <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               Once I had my outerwall, I used the extrude function to create the height (.5") and make solid shapes. I then exported the files as .stl.
